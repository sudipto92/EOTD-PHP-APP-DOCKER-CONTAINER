# Excerpt from my blog post:
"BUILD & RELEASE A CONTAINER IMAGE FROM AZURE DEVOPS TO AZURE WEB APP FOR CONTAINERS"
http://www.buchatech.com/2020/03/build-release-a-container-image-from-azure-devops-to-azure-web-app-for-containers/

In this long blog post I am going to take things a step further and walk-through the build & release of a Container from Azure DevOps to Azure Web App for Containers. The overall goal of this post is to help someone else out if they want to setup a build and release pipeline for building and deploying a container to Azure App Service. We will use a very simple PHP web app I built that will run in the container.

All of the code used in this blog post is hosted here on this GitHub repo.
